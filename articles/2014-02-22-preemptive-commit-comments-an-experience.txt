title: Preemptive commit comments - an experience
date: 22/02/2014

Some weeks ago, [Carlos Vilella][CV] tipped me about Arialdo Martini's
[brilliant blog post][arialdo-preemptive] by. Didn't give much thought
about it at the time, but some days ago this subject came up on a team
conversation, and now I decided I will try to create my own workflow
on top of that idea.

So, as you read on Arialdo's blog post (go read it now), the idea is quite
simple. You just write up your commit messages before even starting to code.
You basically figure out a strategy for the next transformations you want in
your code, and log them in advance. This helps you keep focus, and gives you
space to put stuff you want to do in the short term future.

What I am experimenting with at the moment is a dirty simple workflow based on
that. And by dirty simple, I mean it. No plugins, no complicated setup. Just
something I could pull from the top of my mind should I be seating in a weird
development environment without breaking a sweat or even having to go online.

It's just a file named `PENDING`...

<pre>
√ PlaceIndex supports finding places by name
√ PlaceIndex supports getting places by id
√ PlaceIndex#find becomes #find_all, may return multiple results
  PlaceIndex#find supports regex criteria
  PlaceIndex#get raises exception when no such id
  extracts common code on Index classes to a module
</pre>

... and this simple command line, issued after using `git add -p` to add my
patches to the commit

<pre>
  git commit -m "`grep -v √ PENDING | head -n 1`"
</pre>

Sure, you could choose other character to mark completion; you could choose to
erase the line after completion; you could elect to use `-a` flag in the commit
line - although I consider that bad practice. But that's not my point with this exercise.

My point is that you really ought to create your own protocols and tools for
personal use sometimes, and strive to keep them simple enough so that it does
not get in your way. It's kind-of like the philosophy behind [Bullet
Journal][bullet-journal]: simple, personal, effective, like a hacker's tools
should be.
