title: A new <s>hope</s> blog
date: 20/01/2013

So, following [Nicholas Pufal][nicholas] steps, I decided to try out
[toto], a very minimalistic rackup-based blog engine. It is indeed
pretty neat and simple to setup on [heroku]-like hosting services. It
also supports [markdown] out-of-the-box, which makes writing way
easier.

However, as anything open-source out there, the original authors
of this gem are apparently no longer updating it, and there are some
bugs left unsolved. One of those [bugs] bit me for a while, chewing
markdown's link references in post summaries. Fortunately, just as it
happens oh-so-often with open-source stuff, someone took upon himself
to fix those bugs in a [fork].

As [Jon Maddog Hall][maddog] usually says: ever wondered what would happen if
you, a "home" user,  were having a problem in big proprietary
software? Do you think you'd be given attention? What if I tell you
that in open-source you don't even _need_ attention, and that you can
have full control of your running applications? What if I tell you
that most problems you're going to face have already been solved by
the community?

What if I tell this open stuff can be awesome?
